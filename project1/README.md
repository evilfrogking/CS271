I left comments throughout my code to document my experience.  
Overall, I felt like there was a steep learning curve.  
I told Sam:  
"the chips kinda feel like looking a cuniform

and once you walk back from the more familar way of looking at it then you can see how it makes sense. 
it feels like learning binary all over again haha"
