# Project 2
Finished the majority of Project 2 very smoothly.
There was a bit of an issue towards the end of the ALU; there wasn't an Or16Way, so I needed to split the output for Or8Way.
I also have messed up a variable. Overall, it's a simple fix.
## Programmer Comments
Moved to README for convenience
### ALU.hdl
  // I drew the ALU from the lecture, I will link to it in my github
  // it helped a LOT
  // I accidentally capitalized a character in one of my variables.... devestating
### FullAdder.hdl
  // Started with the simplier version, then moved up
  // Super helps to keep track of the variables to make sure
  // that I've used them all!
### Inc.hdl
  //only want to add 1 integer to the entire 16 bits
