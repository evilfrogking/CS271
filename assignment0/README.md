## Instructions:
1. five topics related to computing (maybe an interesting looking data structure?!) that interest you, maybe even include a link to a page talking about the topic both in this README file and on the discord channel for this class,
2. five topics that you feel are difficult right now or topics that you think are generally difficult topics related to computer or computing,

## Five Topics Related to Computing
1. [Building MirrorMirror](https://blog.dylanjpierce.com/raspberrypi/magicmirror/tutorial/2015/12/27/build-a-magic-mirror.html) I've had this project in my bookmarks since I was 19 years old, and I finally feel capable enough to start attempting it. I want to build a mirror with screen functionality, like displaying a positive message, the date and time, and the weather.
2. [Animal Crossing New Leaf Music](https://www.raspberrypi.com/) Similarly, I would love to code a Raspberry Pi to know the weather and time and play the corresponding Animal Crossing New Leaf song at all times. It would be pretty doable and very whimsical.
3. [Unity Gamemaking](https://learn.unity.com/) A friend reached out to me and wants me to do some backend coding on a game. I have no idea if I have the skills required to do that, but it would be fun to see how far I get!
4. [Digital Archiving](https://guides.lib.umich.edu/c.php?g=992751) Like last term, Digital Archiving is still my main career focus, only now, after data structures, I feel like I'm starting to learn how to do it!
5. [Desktop Pet](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/create-your-own-desktop-pet-with-python-5b369be18868) I also still want to create my desktop pet, which I think will be my summer project!

## Five Topics That Are Difficult
1. (Machine Learning)[https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/machine-learning-explained] I am still figuring out machine learning and artificial intelligence. I understand that we have to try to provide context to a computer for it to learn, but the logistics around that are staggering. 
2. (Fiber Cables)[https://uk.rs-online.com/web/content/discovery/ideas-and-advice/fibre-optic-cables-guide] I've been getting more interested in how computers and networks work, not just how to use them, and I'm still struggling to understand how we can transmit data nearly at the speed of light (or at the speed of light) using fiber cables. Crazy stuff.
3. (Cybersecurity)[https://www.ibm.com/topics/cybersecurity] After taking C 290 last term, even remotely understanding cybersecurity feels much more critical. I have no idea how it works. 
4. (Quantum Computing)[https://scienceexchange.caltech.edu/topics/quantum-science-explained/quantum-computing-computers] this is a wild concept. Is it also kind of existential? I hope to see a quantum computer one day and would love to understand one on even a basic level.
5. (Computer's Learning to Smell)[https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/10/ai-scent-digitizing-smell/675608/] This one is more silly. I have never been able to smell, so the idea that a computer could smell blows my mind! Trying to understand how a computer can learn to smell and how that is different from my understanding of smells just makes computers that much cooler. And smelling kinda gross.
