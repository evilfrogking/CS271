## Program Description
> hack_assembler.py is the Hack Assembler for Nand2Tetris's project 6. The program input's an assembly file using the sys library, converts it to hack line by line, then writes it to a new hack file. That hack file is then able to be run on the provided CPU simulator.

To compile:  
- Main program:

## Programmer Comments
### Aspen
**6/8/24 10:55 PM --** Using Session 12, I set up the basic code for the Assembler using Python. Sam and I had discussed writing the Assembler in C++. However, I am looking to finish the term strong. While I enjoy coding in C++ more, I can get a lot more done more quickly in Python. I set up the basics for the program and the README yesterday and today.  
**6/10/2024 10:56 PM --** Really dug into the book and started my design today; I am going  to work on coding more functional code tomorrow. I will proably move everything into a class, but we will see. I am very sleepy. Also, Sam is going to be coding his project in C++, and I will do mine in Python, and we will compare code and help trobleshoot for each other.  
**6/11/2024 5:34 PM --** I plan on finishing up the project today. I will probably turn it into a class, maybe two, have those in seperate files, and then the main file. The way we set the parser up in class requires the file to be in the same folder, with no oppurtunity for searching a directory (or at least I don't know of one), but I don't really mind that. In normal circumstances, I would prefer to tackle some of those dangling issues. But, I am ready to move on with the term, since I am going to Costa Rica on the study abroad trip. I really need to start prepping for that and commencement. Whew, I am worn out. My design file is kinda a mess, but that's standard for me.  

## TO DO
- finish fuctions
- add a try/ except for the file i/o
- set up classes -> assembler, parser, and source? or just assembler?
