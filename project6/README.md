## Programmer Comments
### Aspen
**6/8/24 10:55 PM --** Using Session 12, I set up the basic code for the Assembler using Python. Sam and I had discussed writing the Assembler in C++. However, I am looking to finish the term strong. While I enjoy coding in C++ more, I can get a lot more done more quickly in Python. I set up the basics for the program and the README yesterday and today.
