## Programmer Comments
### Aspen
**6/8/24 10:55 PM --** Using Session 12, I set up the basic code for the Assembler using Python. Sam and I had discussed writing the Assembler in C++. However, I am looking to finish the term strong. While I enjoy coding in C++ more, I can get a lot more done more quickly in Python. I set up the basics for the program and the README yesterday and today.

>Sam â€” 06/02/2024 8:25 PM  
>are you planing to do the assembler in c++ or python?  
>evilfrogking â€” 06/02/2024 8:31 PM  
>i havent looked at any of the material for it yet, i was going to start tomorrow. but probably c++, just becasue i like it more and i could use pointers  
>but We Will See  
>what are you thinking?  
>Sam â€” 06/02/2024 8:32 PM  
>I could do either, I was also thinking C++ but the python solution using dictionaries looks super straight foward to, I was thinking if C++ got too tough and  
>finals were getting close id switch to python ðŸ˜­  
>is our final date to turn this in next sunday or end of finals?

>ooooooh okokok

>I watched the videos needed for the assembler but I might not be able to fully start working on it until Wednesday,  
>I'll try a little tomorow but the time might   >get eaten up by my math class   
>evilfrogking â€” 06/04/2024 7:33 PM   
>Heard, I have one assignemnt in two other classes and a final thats already been opened,  
>so im kinda thinking about tackling those today and tomorrow so the ONLY >thing i will need to worry about is the assembler and studying for my calculus final  
>Sam â€” 06/04/2024 8:14 PM  
>Completely understandable, I'll look into starting the assembler tonight and work on some of it tomorrow,  
>Thursday is my day off school tho so I'll likely do most >of my work then  
>Also I won't be available much Saturday since that's my sister's graduation nor part of Sunday since I'll be studying for two finals on Monday ðŸ˜­  
>Thankfully that will also mean that I'll have 100% of Tuesday to focus on it  
>evilfrogking â€” 06/04/2024 8:19 PM  
>Do you want to do the project together or work on two separate projects in tandem?  
>i can double check with joseph to see if we work together for the final if >thats what you want!  
>if you dont, then we could just work together on troubleshooting and then maybe take some time on tuesday to compare code? let me know what you think!  
>Sam â€” 06/04/2024 8:26 PM  
>Sure I'm down!  
>evilfrogking â€” 06/04/2024 8:28 PM  
>okay sick! i went ahead and double checked that we could work together on the final.  
>I will be able to work on it a bit on thursday, and then all day friday and >saturday, then on monday after my calculus final and all day on Tuesday  
>Sam â€” 06/04/2024 8:28 PM  
>My only fear is that our schedules won't match up for it well enough since I'm gonna be doing a lot of my work nearing the end of it,  
>if it looks like you're   
>doing most of the work for it early on we can always switch to the second option  
>Sam â€” 06/04/2024 8:28 PM  
>Okay nice!  
>evilfrogking â€” 06/04/2024 8:31 PM  
>thanks for voicing that fear! if it takes like, very little time to actually complete then i can let you know by saturday about the change in plans  
>Sam â€” 06/04/2024 8:31 PM  
>Okokioi sounds good!
