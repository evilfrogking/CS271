## Programmer Comments
### Aspen
**6/8/24 10:55 PM --** Using Session 12, I set up the basic code for the Assembler using Python. Sam and I had discussed writing the Assembler in C++. However, I am looking to finish the term strong. While I enjoy coding in C++ more, I can get a lot more done more quickly in Python. I set up the basics for the program and the README yesterday and today.  
**6/10/2024 10:56 PM --** Really dug into the book and started my design today; I am going  to work on coding more functional code tomorrow. I will proably move everything into a class, but we will see. I am very sleepy. Also, Sam is going to be coding his project in C++, and I will do mine in Python, and we will compare code and help trobleshoot for each other.
