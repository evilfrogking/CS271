## Programmer Comments
### Aspen
**6/8/24 10:55 PM --** Using Session 12, I set up the basic code for the Assembler using Python. Sam and I had discussed writing the Assembler in C++. However, I am looking to finish the term strong. While I enjoy coding in C++ more, I can get a lot more done more quickly in Python. I set up the basics for the program and the README yesterday and today.

are you planing to do the assembler in c++ or python?  
evilfrogking â€” 06/02/2024 8:31 PM  
i havent looked at any of the material for it yet, i was going to start tomorrow. but probably c++, just becasue i like it more and i could use pointers  
but We Will See  
what are you thinking?  
Sam â€” 06/02/2024 8:32 PM  
I could do either, I was also thinking C++ but the python solution using dictionaries looks super straight foward to, I was thinking if C++ got too tough and  
finals were getting close id switch to python ðŸ˜­  
is our final date to turn this in next sunday or end of finals?

ooooooh okokok  
Sam â€” 06/04/2024 12:55 AM    
I watched the videos needed for the assembler but I might not be able to fully start working on it until Wednesday,  
I'll try a little tomorow but the time might   >get eaten up by my math class   
evilfrogking â€” 06/04/2024 7:33 PM   
Heard, I have one assignemnt in two other classes and a final thats already been opened,  
so im kinda thinking about tackling those today and tomorrow so the ONLY >thing i will need to worry about is the assembler and studying for my calculus final  
Sam â€” 06/04/2024 8:14 PM  
Completely understandable, I'll look into starting the assembler tonight and work on some of it tomorrow,  
Thursday is my day off school tho so I'll likely do most >of my work then  
Also I won't be available much Saturday since that's my sister's graduation nor part of Sunday since I'll be studying for two finals on Monday ðŸ˜­  
Thankfully that will also mean that I'll have 100% of Tuesday to focus on it  
evilfrogking â€” 06/04/2024 8:19 PM  
Do you want to do the project together or work on two separate projects in tandem?  
i can double check with joseph to see if we work together for the final if >thats what you want!  
if you dont, then we could just work together on troubleshooting and then maybe take some time on tuesday to compare code? let me know what you think!  
Sam â€” 06/04/2024 8:26 PM  
Sure I'm down!  
evilfrogking â€” 06/04/2024 8:28 PM  
okay sick! i went ahead and double checked that we could work together on the final.  
I will be able to work on it a bit on thursday, and then all day friday and >saturday, then on monday after my calculus final and all day on Tuesday  
Sam â€” 06/04/2024 8:28 PM  
My only fear is that our schedules won't match up for it well enough since I'm gonna be doing a lot of my work nearing the end of it,  
if it looks like you're   
doing most of the work for it early on we can always switch to the second option  
Sam â€” 06/04/2024 8:28 PM  
Okay nice!  
evilfrogking â€” 06/04/2024 8:31 PM  
thanks for voicing that fear! if it takes like, very little time to actually complete then i can let you know by saturday about the change in plans  
Sam â€” 06/04/2024 8:31 PM  
Okokioi sounds good!

BOOM  
Sam â€” 06/06/2024 10:28 AM  
Hell yeah

hey! I sent an email to the dean to request info about turning grades in late    
Greetings Kristina,  
As the term draws close, so does the Computer Science program. Like many of my peers, I have concerns regarding the end of the program and what options professors have for finalizing grades. This email includes some of those students, my computer science professor, and my advisor so that this clarification can be provided to more students in a similar situation as mine.  
I understand that, under normal circumstances, professors can enter grades after the end of the term and have access to upgrading those grades later on if necessary. At the end of last term, I had the opportunity to turn in my final project on the Monday of spring break rather than during my final due date with my professor's permission. With the program ending and the sudden departure of one of the computer science professors, I am aware that my current professor, Joseph Jess, has taken on many additional classes to provide students with as many credits as possible here at LBCC toward their Computer Science degrees. During this stressful time for students and professors, I wanted clarification on whether departing professors would have access to updating grades after the end of this term. I understand there may be a reasonable period when that is no longer possible.  
Many aspects of the program's end have felt confusing, sudden, and frustrating, and I would like to avoid these feelings by reaching out for clarification from you here at the end of the term. I understand that you too have a lot on your plate as the programs ends here in the next week, and I deeply appreciate the time and effort you have taken to read and respond to this email.  
Thank you for the clarification,  
Aspen Frazee  
also, I need to finish this final before i can work on the CS final.  
I was a bit more optimisitic than i realised trying to start the CS final today. I WILL be working on it exclusively tomorrow  
Sam â€” 06/06/2024 9:36 PM   
ooooh nice that's a good email  
and that's completely fair! it'll be easier to work on with less stress too  
I'm thinking of finishing up some late work today and potentially starting on the final a littleeeee bit tonight,  
I got a very rough outline done yesterday but I got tired and no actual code was written I just read the instructions and some of the chapter lol  
tomorow might be a bit busy for me due to having two full classes and another full project ðŸ˜­  
(off topic but another cursed thing about digital logic: we have to copy paste our verilog code onto plain microsoft word ðŸ˜­ its so terrible)  
evilfrogking â€” 06/06/2024 9:44 PM  
you are so good man  
tomorrow i was gonna focus on collecting info, setting up the documentation including like a schedule guide,  
a todo list, and a chat log of our convos, and HOPEFULLY get a little code written  
I am not worried about it at all! i have class for one hour on friday (which i might have to miss anyways because i have an appartment inspection)  
and then im 100% focused on the CS final until sunday when I work.
I am planning on dedicating 1-2 hours a day to study for calculus, but I was going to do that througout my cs studying (like if I got stuck)  
im also okay with like. if I feel like ive gotten pretty far to just shift focus on calculus  
until you are able to work on it some more. weve been working  together for so long now i know we are gonna get it done hahaha  
evilfrogking â€” 06/06/2024 9:44 PM  
whaaaaaaaaa what the fuck nooooooo why ðŸ˜­  
saturday was gonna be my big coding day, and then monday and tuesday  
Sam â€” 06/06/2024 9:46 PM  
heck yeah! Im also pretty confident we can get it done in time, CS crunch time is more enjoyable to me than other classes crunch time too ðŸ˜­  
evilfrogking â€” 06/06/2024 9:47 PM  
dude same hahahaha  
so we wanna try it in c++? I think if saturday hits and im really struggling with it then ill just switch the python and let you know  
but i am like way more fresh with c++ so idk if python would really help me much  
Sam â€” 06/06/2024 9:48 PM  
hell yeah c++!  
I was looking for libraries yestderday, I think <map> and <vector> might be our bread and butter,  
 ðŸ˜­ I started with thinking about importing our old structures from last term and what we might want
for our array/linked lists yestderday before realizing we dont have to build all of that anymore and we can just use vectors like normal people ðŸ˜­  
evilfrogking â€” 06/06/2024 9:52 PM  
oh my god i was so scared reading your message hahaha like "wait why would we need to use our structures - oh thank god we can use vectors"  
god bless vectors my guy, truly unsung heroes

frfr  
lmao  
evilfrogking â€” Yesterday at 7:07 PM  
we do so much of the code in class in python... i might just do it in python.  
if you wanna do it in c++ I totally respet that but all of my finals are due mon/tues next week so im trying to finish this FAST  
so if you want to do it in c++ then maybe we should do separate projects and just troubleshoot together? how do you feel about that?  
Sam â€” Yesterday at 8:06 PM  
that might be good! I like c++ but im also okay with python ðŸ˜­ I might just switch too im suffering due to my decisions today  
I could'nt get my lab to run at the end of today so I have to speed run finishing it now by the end of today ðŸ˜­ plus its report  
evilfrogking â€” Yesterday at 8:08 PM  
oh fuck that sucks so bad ðŸ˜­  
thats WAY too much work  
i didnt end up finishing that one final i wanted to have done on wednesday until this morning...  
i thought it was gonna be like 4 pages but it ended up being 11 ðŸ’€  
i know we did like all of the tables and stuff in class but this does make me feel like im getting a lot done lol  
Sam â€” Yesterday at 8:09 PM  
damnnnnnnnnn  
lol yeee  
evilfrogking â€” Yesterday at 8:10 PM  
i hope you get your project done soon ðŸ«¡  
c++ is like driving a manual car which makes it more fun but i also forget how competent I am in python ðŸ˜­ i can do so much shit in this language  
Sam â€” Yesterday at 8:12 PM  
tru tru tru  
it's my favorite high level language out of the two I know, ðŸ˜­ my goal for this summer is to git gud at JS cause I felt like I super lacked in that last term    
evilfrogking â€” Today at 1:25 PM  
omg session 14 scared the shit out of me when they said "do we still want the assembler to be the final?  
or do we want to switch it to the virtual language 1?" i was like ðŸ«¨  do not do this to meeeeeeeeeeeee  
Sam â€” Today at 1:27 PM  
lol sameeeeeee  
evilfrogking â€” Today at 1:29 PM  
im gonna spend a couple hours studying for calculus, then work on some documentation,  
and then work on the final a bit more. for what i understand, its mostly just generating the binary using the libraries and then writing it to a new hack file.  
im struggling to understand how the labels work in the code exactly?  
i might write some psuedocode out to see if that helps me grasp how that works a bit better.  
but yea, thats what i got going on today! i can work until about midnight tonight.  
tomorrow i have to focus only on math, and then my final ends at 12 on monday so i can focus completely on the cs final monday and tuesday after that.  
i did want to move the functions into a different file just for shits and giggles  
but yeah! thats my schedule as of right now  
like, i know how to write the labels in asm, and i know that we need to associate the labels with the line after them,  
but its tying those two things together in the code that im kinda struggling with understanding   
Sam â€” Today at 1:31 PM  
yeeee i think thats the hard part  
I can start work on it too in a bit but i've got some math homework i gotta chew through  
evilfrogking â€” Today at 1:34 PM  
youre good! today i might work mostly on pseudocode and rewatch part of the lecture and read the textbook.  
if i have a breakthrough i might work on some of the code, but i kinda feel like all of monday and tuesday will be lots of time to finish the project.  
its not as challenging as i thought honestly
